# Zoya

Zoya is a simple functional programming language. 
It features:
- Haskell like syntax 
- Types:
    - Lists of any type
    - Ints
    - Bools
    - Custom recursive and polymorphic types
- Capturing Lambdas with Rust like syntax
- Nested Pattern matching
- Static type checking
- Pattern matching completeness checker
- Execution error checking
- Partial function application
- Higher order functions
- Polymorphic types
- Type reconstruction algorithm

Additionally to each program Prelude is added with usefull functions and types eg. :
- true / false
- list operations
- Maybe / Either
